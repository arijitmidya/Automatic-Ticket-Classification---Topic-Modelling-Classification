I am asking the bank to validate the debt. Instead I been receiving mail every month from them attempting to collect a debt. \\nI have a right to know this information as a consumer. \\n\\nChase account # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Thanks in advance for your help.\n",

I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.\n",

              "17    With out notice J.P. Morgan Chase restricted my account by my debit card Tuesday XX/XX/2019. On Thursday XX/XX/2019 I went into A branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed. I went into the branch to see how I can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned. The bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would Post but they may take an additional business day. That Saturday I attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on Friday, XX/XX/2019. Upon looking at my account I realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement. Ive been called and I was told that it may take two business day stating Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only. Now, Chase is informing me that I will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently. Unfortunately, This has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments, etc. I am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that I have peace of mind in fact Chase has handled my situation grossly I even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself. Although I know that Chase reserves the right to close my account at any time I do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document.

I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018.

On Thursday XX/XX/2019 I went into A branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed. I went into the branch to see how I can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned. The bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would Post but they may take an additional business day. That Saturday I attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on Friday, XX/XX/2019. Upon looking at my account I realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement. Ive been called and I was told that it may take two business day stating Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only. Now, Chase is informing me that I will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently. Unfortunately, This has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments, etc. I am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that I have peace of mind in fact Chase has handled my situation grossly I even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself. Although I know that Chase reserves the right to close my account at any time I do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document. I am not being a shored or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that I have peace of mind in fact Chase has handled my situation grossly I even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself.

This situation is truly affecting my livelihood and they dont seem to want to deal with Me professionally. Thank you</td>\n",

demand reserve for specify cash balance in my xxxx account in reserve for a provision in my xxxx divorce decree that have previously be satisfied with my ex - wife ; demand further cash reserve beyond   mos balance which be hold in chase account by require account at other bank ;

i.e. , cash out or owelty rate & term refinance but not combine ;   ) chase order an appraisal which be available to use by another lender who actually understand how to process and owelty refinance and refuse to allow for the appraisal to be release and thereby cause duplicate expense and further delay ;   ) chase have claim that new requirement for conventional loan have be publish as a result of covid- and now require I to assert that I be self - employ - which I believe chase be do so that the rate chase lock for this loan and the type of product can be change to cover up their series of error and charge more for the loan . \\n\\n lastly , chase have collect all of the documentation request and have edit the entry on the application and demand that I sign these modify form . I notice several error and omission on their part in how they record the datum they demand and to which I provide document , yet they have not correct those same form . \\n\\n I believe chase be act in bad faith and be fabricate unreasonable demand to delay progress on the application because they know they can not proceed as a split cash - out / owelty rate & term loan as they have construct . the chase management have give excuse that they can not release the appraisal because they could be help liable ; state that the covid- rule require xxxx attestation and will not confirm that chase will refund the { $ . } I pay at application .\",\n          \"in xx / xx/ I open a xxxx auto loan with chase bank . today , I try to make my payment via the telephone and be unsure of whether it have go through or not .

demand reserve for specify cash balance in my xxxx account in reserve for a provision in my xxxx divorce decree that have previously be satisfied with my ex - wife ; demand further cash reserve beyond   mos balance which be hold in chase account by require account at other bank ;

and chase demand that   % of the cash - out proceed be hold in escrow to transfer at close to my ex - wife as chase be declare this loan to now be a settlement of owelty lien . \\n\\n my complaint be three fold :   ) chase change the term and create a situation where the loan product be not an allowable loan ; i.e. , cash out or owelty rate & term refinance but not combine ;   ) chase order an appraisal which be available to use by another lender who actually understand how to process and owelty refinance and refuse to allow for the appraisal to be release and thereby cause duplicate expense and further delay ;   ) chase have claim that new requirement for conventional loan have be publish as a result of covid- and now require I to assert that I be self - employ - which I believe chase be do so that the rate chase lock for this loan and the type of product can be change to cover up their series of error and charge more for the loan . \\n\\n lastly , chase have collect all of the documentation request and have edit the entry on the application and demand that I sign these modify form . I notice several error and omission on their part in how they record the datum they demand and to which I provide document , yet they have not correct those same form . \\n\\n I believe chase be act in bad faith and be fabricate unreasonable demand to delay progress on the application because they know they can not proceed as a split cash - out / owelty rate & term loan as they have construct . the chase management have give excuse that they can not release the appraisal because they could be help liable ; state that the covid- rule require xxxx attestation and will not confirm that chase will refund the { $ . } I pay at application .\",\n          \"in xx / xx/ I open a xxxx auto loan with chase bank . today , I try to make my payment via the telephone and be unsure of whether it have go through or not .

( the { $ . } transaction be subsequently wash ) . I make a call to chase bank about the atm transaction and to report and file a claim , I be tell by the representative that I will be credit { $ . } in xxxx hrs .

I go to visit the branch to see if there be anything that can be do for I , I be tell that just what I do be exactly the same procedure they must follow , as the branch do not service the atm , it be do by their back office personnel . on xxxx xxxx the amount of { $ . } previously credit to my account be reverse .

              "11  on xx/xx/, while trying to book a xxxx  xxxx  ticket, i came across an offer for {$.} to be applied towards the ticket if i applied for a rewards card. i put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. i immediately contacted xxxx and was referred to chase bank. i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than  of getting the notification on the screen and i was told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. i asked for more information about the xxxx  offer and she explained that even if i had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. i then explicitly told her i was glad i got denied and i was absolutely no longer interested in the account. i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. this all happened no later than  after putting in the application on xx/xx/. notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i was told by the chase representative, chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on xx/xx/. this is now being reported in my credit report and chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which i did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

demand reserve for specify cash balance in my xxxx account in reserve for a provision in my xxxx divorce decree that have previously be satisfied with my ex - wife ; demand further cash reserve beyond   mos balance which be hold in chase account by require account at other bank ;

i.e. , cash out or owelty rate & term refinance but not combine ;   ) chase order an appraisal which be available to use by another lender who actually understand how to process and owelty refinance and refuse to allow for the appraisal to be release and thereby cause duplicate expense and further delay ;   ) chase have claim that new requirement for conventional loan have be publish as a result of covid- and now require I to assert that I be self - employ - which I believe chase be do so that the rate chase lock for this loan and the type of product can be change to cover up their series of error and charge more for the loan . \\n\\n lastly , chase have collect all of the documentation request and have edit the entry on the application and demand that I sign these modify form . I notice several error and omission on their part in how they record the datum they demand and to which I provide document , yet they have not correct those same form . \\n\\n I believe chase be act in bad faith and be fabricate unreasonable demand to delay progress on the application because they know they can not proceed as a split cash - out / owelty rate & term loan as they have construct . the chase management have give excuse that they can not release the appraisal because they could be help liable ; state that the covid- rule require xxxx attestation and will not confirm that chase will refund the { $ . } I pay at application .\",\n          \"in xx / xx/ I open a xxxx auto loan with chase bank . today , I try to make my payment via the telephone and be unsure of whether it have go through or not .
